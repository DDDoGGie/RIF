# Detect spatially variable gene using RIF Explainer

Unlike prior methods that leverage separate clustering algorithms (e.g., mclust, K-means) on learned representations, RIF seamlessly connects representation learning and SDI, which enables interpretation
of the trained network to identify (Spatially variable genes) SVGs that play a significant role in distinguishing spatial domains.
